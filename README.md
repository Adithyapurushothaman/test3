test3 is to demonstrate the services and dependency injection.
We created 3 components (ng g c component_name).
added these components in app.component.html by <app-component_name> tag.
Added a button in each component and performed button action by (click)="function_name()" inside button tag.
These functions are declared and defined inside in the Ts file of each component.
